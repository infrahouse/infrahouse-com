# Terms of Service for GitHub Backup Service

*Last Updated: November 9, 2024*

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the GitHub Backup Service 
("Service") provided by InfraHouse Inc. 
("we," "us," "our"). By accessing or using the Service, 
you agree to comply with these Terms. 
If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Service Overview

The GitHub Backup Service provides daily backups of your GitHub repositories. 
The backups are stored in an AWS S3 bucket, provided by you, 
and are subject to the following terms:

* Backups occur daily at UTC midnight.
* The backup process temporarily stores your data on a memory volume, 
which is deleted immediately after the backup job is completed.
* The backup data is stored securely in the AWS S3 bucket that you provide and 
manage.


## 2. Backup Process

* **Backup Frequency**: The backup service runs once daily at UTC midnight, 
ensuring that your GitHub repositories are backed up regularly.
* **Temporary Data Storage**: During the backup process, 
your data will be stored temporarily on a memory volume to complete 
the backup job. This data is automatically deleted as soon as 
the backup is finished.
* **Backup Location**: All backup data will be stored in 
the AWS S3 bucket provided by you. You are responsible 
for the security and access control of your S3 bucket.

## 3. Customer Responsibilities

As a customer, you agree to:

* **Provide an AWS S3 Bucket**: You must provide a valid AWS S3 bucket 
where your backups will be stored. You are solely 
responsible for the security, access controls, 
and proper configuration of your S3 bucket.
* **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized 
individuals have access to your AWS S3 bucket, 
and that backup data is appropriately secured.
* **Content of Repositories**: Ensure that repositories selected 
for backup do not contain sensitive or confidential information 
that is not suitable for storage in a third-party cloud service.

## 4. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures 
to protect the data processed through the Service. 
However, the security of data transmitted or stored on 
the internet cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable 
for any unauthorized access to your data, unless such access 
results from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

We are not liable for any loss or damage to your data, including data loss, 
corruption, or deletion, except where such loss is caused 
by our failure to follow the terms of this agreement 
or by gross negligence or willful misconduct.

We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, 
consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of 
the Service, even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 6. Service Availability

While we strive to provide a reliable and uninterrupted service, 
we cannot guarantee 100% uptime. 
There may be periods of downtime due to maintenance, updates, 
or unforeseen technical issues. We will endeavor to notify you of 
planned maintenance in advance but cannot be held liable for service outages.

## 7. Termination

You or we may terminate this agreement at any time by discontinuing 
use of the Service. Upon termination, all backup data will be deleted, 
unless required by law to retain it.

## 8. Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue 
the Service at any time, with or without notice. 
We may update these Terms of Service from time to time, 
and any changes will be effective once posted on our website 
or communicated to you.

## 9. Compliance with Laws

You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, 
including those related to data protection and privacy, 
in connection with your use of the Service.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, 
and hold harmless InfraHouse Inc., its affiliates, officers, 
directors, employees, agents, and contractors from and against 
any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, 
and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or relating 
to your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, 
or any violation of law.

## 11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms will be governed by the laws of California. 
Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of 
the Service will be resolved through arbitration, 
in accordance with the rules of American Arbitration Association (AAA) 
in California.
