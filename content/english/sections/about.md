title: "Hey, I am Alex!"
description: "At InfraHouse, I’m on a mission to redefine how startups approach infrastructure by delivering exceptional quality at an affordable price. Having worked as an infrastructure and database engineer at companies like Box, Dropbox, Pinterest, and various startups, I’ve seen firsthand how much startups overpay for mediocre solutions. I believe early-stage companies deserve infrastructure that scales with their ambitions — reliable, efficient, and tailored to their unique needs—without breaking the bank. InfraHouse is committed to empowering startups with world-class infrastructure solutions, enabling them to achieve better results, innovate faster, and grow smarter, all while keeping costs predictable and manageable."
