This Privacy Policy explains how InfraHouse Inc. ("we," "us," "our") collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our GitHub Backup Service. By using our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Backup Data**: Data related to the backup process, including metadata about the repository and backup job.

## 2. Backup Process

Backup Frequency: Backups are taken daily at UTC midnight.

Temporary Data Storage: Customer data is stored temporarily on a memory volume during the backup process. This data is automatically deleted as soon as the backup job is completed.
Storage Location: Backups are stored in an AWS S3 bucket, which is provided by the customer. The customer is responsible for ensuring the security and access control of their AWS S3 bucket.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

Temporary Storage: During the backup process, customer data is stored temporarily on a memory volume. This data is deleted immediately after the backup job is completed, and no copies are retained.
Backup Data: All backup data is securely stored in the AWS S3 bucket provided by the customer. We do not have access to the contents of the S3 bucket unless authorized by the customer.
